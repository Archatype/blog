      <h1 class="left">Applications:</h1>
      <h2 class="left">Atom</h2>
      <p>When it comes to text editors, Atom is </br>my all-time favorite. It looks nice, everything </br>is customizable, and it has many options to </br>give the user a comfortable experience.</p>
      <h2 class="left">Sketch</h2>
      <p>Photoshop is an amazing application, but</br> I like sketch a lot more. Its less demanding, </br>more simple, cheaper, and has everything </br>I need.</p>
      <h2 class="left">Prepros</h2>
      <p>I dont use prepros to its fullest extent</br> because I dont use preprocessors (yet...), </br>but I love to use prepros to live preview my </br>websites.</p>
      <h2 class="left">Github App</h2>
      <p>I dont use the Github app as much as the </br>terminal, but its nice to have if I dont want </br>to use the terminal.</p>
      <h2 class="left">Terminal</h2>
      <p>Although the Github app is easy to use, the </br>terminal is a lot more flexible.</p>
      <h2 class="left">Google Chrome</h2>
      <p>Chrome is my all-time favorite browser. I use </br>all browsers for cross-browser testing, but use </br>chrome as my main browser.</p>

      <h1 class="right">Organization:</h1>
      <h2 class="right2">Trello</h2>
      <p class="right3">Trello is great for me because it helps me focus on one thing at a time.</p>
      <h2 class="right2">Dropbox</h2>
      <p class="right3">Dropbox is my go-to for storage. 1TB of cloud storage for </br>not too big of a cost.</p>
      <h2 class="right2">Google Calender</h2>
      <p class="right3">I started using Google Calender because I noticed that my schedule & time management skills were terrible.</p>

      <h1 class="left">Learning:</h1>
      <h2 class="left">Youtube</h2>
      <p>If I want to learn something new, Youtube would be the first site I would go to.</p>
      <h2 class="left">HTML & CSS and Javascript & Jquery book </br> By: Jon Duckett</h2>
      <p>These two books helped me incredibly when starting out in </br>web development. I am still reading the Javascript one, and </br>I still look through the HTML&CSS book when I want a refresher</br> on a certain concept. Check out the book here (An affiliate link).</p>
      <h2 class="left">Treehouse</h2>
      <p>Treehouse helped me out a bit, especially with Javascript. </br>The problem was that I already dove into programming </br>before treehouse, so it was really boring to go through </br>all the stuff I lready knew to complete a stack.</p>
      <h2 class="left">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</h2>
      <p>This site has everything you need to know about web dev </br>(Well.. HTML, CSS, and Javascript). Need to know what a </br>function does? MDN. Need a web API refrence? MDN.</p>
      <h2 class="left">Code School</h2>
      <p>I havent used codeschool yet, but have been told that its </br>targeted towards intermediate programmers, so I thought </br>that I should add it to my list for future use.</p>

      <h1 class="right">Utilities:</h1>
      <h2 class="right2">Google Fonts</h2>
      <p class="right3">Not much to say but GFonts is the bes place to get fonts.</p>
      <h2 class="right2">Placehold.it</h2>
      <p class="right3">This thing is amazing. It eliminates the stress factor of </br>having to manually resize images constantly to get a right </br>fit on your website. </p>
      <h2 class="right2">Animate.css</h2>
      <p class="right3">Great tool if you dont want to make your own animations. Dont reinvent the wheel.</p>
      <h2 class="right2">Pixlr</h2>
      <p class="right3">This site is great for quick editing. Its no photoshop, but its nice to have.</p>
      <h2 class="right2">Foundation</h2>
      <p class="right3">I may use foundation in the future, but id like to get the </br>hang of writing code by scratch before getting into frameworks.</p>
